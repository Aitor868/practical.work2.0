# Practical Work 2.0

##  Description
This project consists of a personal academic website created for the subject *Fundamentals of Computer Engineering*. It includes multiple pages with structured content such as "About Me", "My Degree", and "Contact", following modern web development practices using HTML and CSS.

The aim was to consolidate theoretical knowledge into a functional website and deploy it using GitHub Pages.

##  Problems Encountered
- Difficulty in embedding external files such as CVs in a responsive manner.
- GitHub repository structure and correct HTML validation required troubleshooting.
- CSS conflicts initially occurred due to multiple style files (later unified into one).

##  Conclusions
The project strengthened key skills in:
- HTML/CSS structuring
- Web accessibility
- Content organization and academic documentation
- Using GitHub effectively for collaboration and deployment
