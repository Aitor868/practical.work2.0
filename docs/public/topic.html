                    <h2>About Soccer</h2>
                    <p>Soccer, known as football outside the United States, is a globally beloved sport played by two teams of eleven players. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net without using hands or arms, except by the goalkeeper. The simplicity of the game's rules and minimal equipment requirements have contributed to its widespread popularity.</p>

                    <p>The origins of soccer date back over two millennia to ancient civilizations. However, the modern version of the game began to take shape in England in the mid-19th century. In 1863, the Football Association was established in England, formalizing the rules and distinguishing soccer from rugby. This pivotal moment laid the foundation for the sport's global development.</p>
